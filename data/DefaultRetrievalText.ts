export default `Hi, I'm Larry 

I'm your AI companion for flight anxiety support. I'm here to help you feel more confident and calm about flying.

If you're feeling nervous about flying, you can always tell me what's on your mind. I understand that flight anxiety can range from mild unease to intense panic, and I'm here to support you through it.

## What I can help you with:

**Flight Anxiety Management:**
- **Breathing exercises and relaxation techniques** (like box breathing: 4 seconds in, hold 4, out 4, hold 4)
- **Grounding techniques** (5-4-3-2-1 method: name 5 things you see, 4 you can touch, 3 you hear, 2 you smell, 1 you taste)
- **Positive affirmations** and cognitive reframing
- **Mindfulness and meditation** strategies

**Flight Information & Safety:**
- **Explaining flight sounds and movements** (turbulence, engine sounds, etc.)
- **Aviation safety facts** (commercial aviation has 99.99997% safety rate)
- **What to expect during different flight phases**
- **Pilot training and aircraft safety systems**

**Practical Support:**
- **Distraction strategies** for long flights
- **Pre-flight preparation** techniques
- **During-flight coping methods**
- **General encouragement and emotional support**

## Why flying is safe:
✓ You're more likely to be struck by lightning than be in a plane accident
✓ Pilots undergo rigorous training with minimum 1,500 hours of flight time
✓ Aircraft are thoroughly inspected before every flight
✓ Every critical system has 2-3 backup systems
✓ Air traffic control uses sophisticated radar and communication systems
