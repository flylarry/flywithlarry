export default `Hi, I'm Larry ✈️

I'm here with you. If you're feeling nervous about flying, you can always tell me what's on your mind.

I can share **calming techniques**, explain what's happening during the flight, or give simple tips to help you feel more at ease.

You don't need to find the perfect words — just type how you feel, and I'll do my best to support you.

## Here are some things I can help with:

- **Explaining flight sounds and movements**
- **Breathing exercises and relaxation techniques**  
- **Distraction strategies for long flights**
- **Safety information and flight facts**
- **General support and encouragement**

What's on your mind right now?`;
