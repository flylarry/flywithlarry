# üìò Documentation: `DefaultRetrievalText.ts`

## Purpose

`DefaultRetrievalText.ts` contains the **base fallback text** that is used when:

1. No relevant scenario is found in the `retrieval_snippets` database.
2. User opens the application for the first time and hasn't provided any context yet.
3. Need to provide a warm, friendly **"Hello state"** without being too narrow in response.

This is **"Larry's default voice"**.

---

## Structure

```ts
const DEFAULT_RETRIEVAL_TEXT = `
Hi, I'm Larry ‚úàÔ∏è  
I'm here with you. If you're feeling nervous about flying, you can always tell me what's on your mind.  
I can share calming techniques, explain what's happening during the flight, or give simple tips to help you feel more at ease.  

You don't need to find the perfect words ‚Äî just type how you feel, and I'll do my best to support you.
`;

export default DEFAULT_RETRIEVAL_TEXT;
```

---

## Usage

- **In `UploadDocumentsForm.tsx`:**

  ```tsx
  const [document, setDocument] = useState(DEFAULT_RETRIEVAL_TEXT);
  ```

- **Fallback in retrieval API route:**

  ```ts
  if (!matchedSnippet) {
    return DEFAULT_RETRIEVAL_TEXT;
  }
  ```

- **Onboarding / first-time chat UI:**
  Used as a greeting when there's no message history yet.

## Design Principles

1. **Warm & empathetic tone** ‚Üí user should feel that the bot is _"a friend who's always there"_.
2. **Universal fallback** ‚Üí suitable for both newcomers and returning users.
3. **Non-medical disclaimer (implicit)** ‚Üí reminder that this is not a doctor, but support is available.
4. **Invites engagement** ‚Üí encourages user to share their feelings.
